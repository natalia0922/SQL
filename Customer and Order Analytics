#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.


#1. How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT COUNT (*) orderID
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)= 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT (*) product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product= 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID)= 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderID)= 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';



#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price  asc
LIMIT 1;




#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;



#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT product, location, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location= '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;



#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT COUNT (cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id= Feb.orderID
WHERE quantity>2
AND length(orderID)= 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
