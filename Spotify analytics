---What is the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 

SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG (danceability), AVG (popularity), AVG (energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;


--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--Creating the table: 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL)

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL


---What are the top 10 artist by popularity

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER by popularity desc
LIMIT 10;


--What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs? 
SELECT track_name, popularity, avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name, danceability
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;


---What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms  desc
LIMIT 1;

--Query the average tempo from Spotifydata
SELECT AVG(tempo)
FROM  BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--Query the top 10 songs to see if they are above or below the average tempo
SELECT track_name, tempo,
(CASE
  WHEN tempo > 121 THEN 'above average'
  WHEN tempo = 121 THEN 'average'
  WHEN tempo < 121 THEN 'below average'
END) as Compareaverage
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
LIMIT 10;
